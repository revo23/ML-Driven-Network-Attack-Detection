**Overview**

Using AutoGluon (Tree-Based Models: XGBoost, LightGBM, Random Forest, KNN)  
This notebook demonstrates an end-to-end machine learning workflow for network intrusion detection using two real-world flow datasets.  

1. Data collection and preprocessing
2. Feature selection and dataset preparation
3. Model training using AutoGluon : Tree-based models including XGBoost, LightGBM, Random Forest, KNN
4. Evaluation on primary and secondary datasets
5. Performance comparison and visualization
6. Interactive prediction interface (Gradio)
